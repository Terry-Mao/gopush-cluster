# Message configuration file example

# Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
#
# 1kb => 1024 bytes
# 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
# 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.

# Note on units: when time duration is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1s 5M 4h and so forth:
#
# 1s => 1000 * 1000 * 1000 nanoseconds
# 1m => 60 seconds
# 1h => 60 minutes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1h 1H are all the same.

# Message service tcp listen and server on this address, 
# default tcp listen localhost:8070
# Examples:
#
# rpc.bind 192.168.1.100:8070,10.0.0.1:8070
# rpc.bind 127.0.0.1:8070
# rpc.bind 0.0.0.0:8070
rpc.bind localhost:8070

# If the master process is run as root, then message will setuid()/setgid() 
# to USER/GROUP. If GROUP is not specified, then message uses the same name as 
# USER. By default it's nobody user and nobody or nogroup group.
user nobody

# When running daemonized, Message writes a pid file in 
# /tmp/gopush-cluster-message.pid by default. You can specify a custom pid file 
# location here.
pidfile /tmp/gopush-cluster-message.pid

# Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously.
# This call will go away when the scheduler improves. By default the number of 
# logical CPUs is set.
# 
# maxproc 4

# The working directory.
#
# Note that you must specify a directory here, not a file name.
dir ./

# This is used by message service profiling (pprof).
# By default message pprof listens for connections from local interfaces on 8170
# port. It's not safty for listening internet IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# pprof.bind 192.168.1.100:8170,10.0.0.1:8170
# pprof.bind 127.0.0.1:8170
# pprof.bind 0.0.0.0:8170
pprof.bind localhost:8170

# Storage type, Support: redis, mysql. We suggest use redis, cause mysql is low 
# efficency. Now, only support to run one of both in the same time
type redis

[redis]
# Close connections after remaining idle for this duration. If the value
# is zero, then idle connections are not closed. Applications should set
# the timeout to a value less than the server's timeout.
timeout 28800s

# Maximum number of idle connections in the pool.
idle 100

# Maximum number of connections allocated by the pool at a given time.
# When zero, there is no limit on the number of connections in the pool.
active 300

# Max quantity of stored message for each key, default 20
store 20

# ketama virtual node base number

# The format like "NodeName IP:Port", NodeName was specified by Comet service.
# If there are multiple nodes, then configure following
# nodeN:W, N is node name, W is node weight
# node1:1 IP1:Port1
# node2:2 IP2:Port2
# node3:3 IP3:Port3
node1:1 localhost:6379

# Delete all of expired message loop time interval

# Database source.
# For example with the following

# The zookeeper cluster section. When message start, it will register data in 
# the zookeeper cluster and create a ephemeral node. When message died, the 
# node will drop by zookeeper cluster. So we can use the feature implement node 
# failover.
[zookeeper]
# Zookeeper cluster addresses. Mutiple address split by a ",".
# Examples:
#
# addr 192.168.1.100:2181,10.0.0.1:2181
# addr 127.0.0.1:2181
addr localhost:2181

# Zookeeper cluster session idle timeout seconds. Zookeeper will close the 
# connection after a client is idle for N seconds, Zookeeper will send heartbeat
# after timeout / 2 second.
# Examples:
#
# timeout 30s
# timeout 15s
timeout 30s

# message create ephemeral node at the specified root path.
#
# Note the path must start with "/".
path /gopush-cluster-message
