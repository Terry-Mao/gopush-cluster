# Comet configuration file example

# Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
#
# 1kb => 1024 bytes
# 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
# 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.

# Note on units: when time duration is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1s 5M 4h and so forth:
#
# 1s => 1000 * 1000 * 1000 nanoseconds
# 1m => 60 seconds
# 1h => 60 minutes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1h 1H are all the same.

# If the master process is run as root, then comet will setuid()/setgid() 
# to USER/GROUP. If GROUP is not specified, then comet uses the same name as 
# USER. By default it's nobody user and nobody or nogroup group.
user nobody 

# When running daemonized, Comet writes a pid file in 
# /tmp/gopush-cluster-comet.pid by default. You can specify a custom pid file 
# location here.
pidfile /tmp/gopush-cluster-comet.pid

# Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously.
# This call will go away when the scheduler improves. By default the number of 
# logical CPUs is set.
# 
# maxproc 4

# By default comet listens for connections from all the network interfaces
# available on the server on 6968 port. It is possible to listen to just one or 
# multiple interfaces using the "websocket.bind" configuration directive, 
# followed by one or more IP addresses and port.
#
# Examples:
#
# Note this directive is only support "websocket" protocol
# websocket.bind 192.168.1.100:6968,10.0.0.1:7068
# websocket.bind 127.0.0.1:6968
# websocket.bind 0.0.0.0:6968
websocket.bind localhost:6968,localhost:7068

# By default comet listens for connections from all the network interfaces
# available on the server on 6969 port. It is possible to listen to just one or 
# multiple interfaces using the "tcp.bind" configuration directive, followed by 
# one or more IP addresses and port.
#
# Examples:
#
# Note this directive is only support "tcp" protocol
# tcp.bind 192.168.1.100:6969,10.0.0.1:7069
# tcp.bind 127.0.0.1:6969
# tcp.bind 0.0.0.0:6969
tcp.bind localhost:6969,localhost:7069

# This is used by rpc listen for internal protocol.
# By default comet admin listens for connections from local interfaces on 6970
# port. It's not safty for listening internet IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# rpc.bind 192.168.1.100:6970,10.0.0.1:7070
# rpc.bind 127.0.0.1:6970
# rpc.bind 0.0.0.0:6970
rpc.bind localhost:6970,localhost:7070

# This is used by comet service profiling (pprof).
# By default comet pprof listens for connections from local interfaces on 6971
# port. It's not safty for listening internet IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# pprof.bind 192.168.1.100:6971,10.0.0.1:6971
# pprof.bind 127.0.0.1:6971
# pprof.bind 0.0.0.0:6971
pprof.bind localhost:6971

# This is used by comet service get stat info by http.
# By default comet pprof listens for connections from local interfaces on 6972
# port. It's not safty for listening internet IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# stat.bind 192.168.1.100:6971,10.0.0.1:6971
# stat.bind 127.0.0.1:6971
# stat.bind 0.0.0.0:6971
stat.bind localhost:6972

# The working directory.
#
# The log will be written inside this directory, with the filename specified
# above using the 'logfile' configuration directive.
#  
# Note that you must specify a directory here, not a file name.
dir ./

# Log4go configuration xml path.

# log /gopush/log.xml

# SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF are options to adjust the normal buffer sizes 
# allocated for output and input buffers, respectively.  The buffer size may 
# be increased for high-volume connections, or may be decreased to limit the 
# possible backlog of incoming data.  The system places an absolute limit on 
# these values.
# 
# Sets the maximum socket send buffer in bytes.  The kernel doubles
# this value (to allow space for bookkeeping overhead) when it is set using
# setsockopt(2). The default value is set by the 
# /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default file and the maximum allowed value is set by 
# the /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max file.  The minimum (doubled) value for this 
# option is 2048.
sndbuf.size 2048

# Sets the maximum socket receive buffer in bytes. The kernel doubles this 
# value (to allow space for bookkeeping overhead) when it is set using

# /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default file, and the maximum allowed value is set by 
# the /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max file. The minimum (doubled) value

# Note this directive is only support "tcp" protocol
bufio.num 128

# TCP keepalive.
#
# If non-zero, use SO_KEEPALIVE to send TCP ACKs to clients in absence
# of communication. This is useful for two reasons:
#
# 1) Detect dead peers.
# 2) Take the connection alive from the point of view of network
#    equipment in the middle.
#
# On Linux, the specified value (in seconds) is the period used to send ACKs.
# Note that to close the connection the double of the time is needed.
# On other kernels the period depends on the kernel configuration.
#
# A reasonable value for this option is 60 seconds.
